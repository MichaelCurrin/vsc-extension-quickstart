# Deploy

You can _export_ your extension.

Then it can be _installed_ globally for yourself and shared with others so they can install it too. That is more permanent than running in debug mode as covered in the [Development](development.md#start-the-extension) doc.

You can also _publish_ the extension to the VS Code marketplace so it can be found easily.

See the [Extensions][] guide in my Dev Cheatsheets repo - that covers how to export, install and publish a VSIX extension file.
