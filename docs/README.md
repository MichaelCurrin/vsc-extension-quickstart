# VS Code Extensions docs




## About

This project covers the outline of basic VS Code extension that can be installed and run. This template was generated using the `yeoman` NPM package and the "default" option, as covered below in [How to generate a new extension from scratch](#how-to-generate-a-new-extension-from-scratch).

This project is just a simple "Hello world" application - see [How to run the extension](#how-to-run-the-extension) to try it out locally.

This project will not be developed further. It will mainly serve as a reference for existing projects. Or possibly as a template for new projects (with the difference that values have to be replaced manually rather than setup using a CLI).
