## License

Released under [MIT](/LICENSE).

The base of this project comes from the `yo code` command. Very little code has been changed since then - mostly styling changes.

All documentation other than the [README.template.md](/README-template.md), [CHANGELOG.template.md](/CHANGELOG.template.md) and [welcome.md](welcome.md] files is my own.
